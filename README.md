## Pathfinding Algorithms Visualizer

A website built with React that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms.

### Why build a visualizer?

Graph algorithms are some of the most important algorithms taught in any algorithms course. They also tend to be some of the more challenging algorithms to understand.

**This website was built with a few specific goals:**

* To simplify how these algorithms work in real time
* To understand which algorithms are appropriate for different scenarios
* To visualize their difference and efficiency
